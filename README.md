# ConnectionPoints

ConnectionPoints is a fun way to engage with your friends, family, and coworkers. It is a simple game that allows you to
connect with people in a meaningful way. The premise is simple, each user composes challenges for others to complete.
They can be as simple as "Call your mom", "Take a 20 minute walk", or "Read 10 pages of a book", or "Go to the gym". The
possibilities are endless. Each challenge is worth a certain number of points. The point value is set by the user who created
the challenge. When a challenge is completed, the user who completed the challenge is awarded the points provided the
issuer of the challenge approves the completion. Challenges can be time bound and are extremely simple to create.
This low friction means that you can capture things in the moment and create challenges that are relevant to the
day-to-day activities of your life.

This brings us to the flip side of the app. Rewards. Each user can define rewards that they are willing to give to
other users. These rewards can be anything from "Buy you a coffee", "Give you a hug", or "Take you to dinner". The
possibilities are, again, endless. Users can save up points for larger more valuable rewards or use them for smaller
rewards. The balancing mechanism of the game is based on the same principles that drive any bartering system. This
means users will naturally gravitate towards challenges and rewards that are sufficiently balanced. Not rewarding
enough points, and no one will complete your challenges. Rewarding too graciously and you may find yourself on the
hook for a lot of favors! The app is designed to be a fun way to connect with people and to encourage people to do
physical activities, but it can be used for anything. The app is designed to be flexible enough to be used in any setting.
